This was a Launch Academy Challenge, the challege was to parse a 1000+ line
csv, and create a rails app to display the sales date.  The parse is done in
the seeds file.
To get the app running locally:
-clone the repo
-rake db:create
-rake db:migrate
-rake db:seed
-start your server and your good to go.
